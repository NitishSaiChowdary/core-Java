//partially checked exception are throwble and exception 

//what is fully checked exception?
//A checked exception is said to be full checked exception if and only its all the child class also checked 
//eg:Io Exception ,SQL Exception 

//How to aviod finally block 
//yes ,write system.exit(0)
