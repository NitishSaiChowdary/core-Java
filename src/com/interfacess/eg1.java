////Interface:
//In Interface we can have only abstract methods
//Interface can be implemented by using implements keyword
//From Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface
//From 9, 10, ...
        //some implementeions 
        //1.In Interface we declare all the abstract methods by default they are public abstract
		//2.In Interface all the variables must be public static final by default
		//3.If a class implements more than interface, then we can separate them by comma
		//4.In some of the cases, we don't want to implement all the abstract methods in interface
		//5.In Java for normal class we cannot extend both the classes (multiple inheritance not supported) So, in interface it is possible
		//6.In Java we can extend a class and implement a interface in same class
